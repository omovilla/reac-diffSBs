Code used in "Maximum entropy inference of reaction-diffusion equations"
The code solves the interacting particle Schr√∂dinger bridge problem for reaction-diffusion systems.
The provided code is written for one species with a prior that can be adapted (the default prior is the KKP-Fisher equation).
The initial and final boundary conditions should also be adapted to the particular problem.
